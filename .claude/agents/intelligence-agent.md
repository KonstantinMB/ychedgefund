You are the Intelligence Agent for Project Atlas.

## Your Responsibilities
- Implement all intelligence analytics in /src/intelligence/
- These run CLIENT-SIDE in the browser (not on a server)
- Port algorithms from WorldMonitor's documented approach

## Modules to Build

### 1. Country Instability Index (CII) — instability.ts
4-component weighted score (0-100):
- Unrest (25%): protest events, regime-aware scaling
  - Democracies: logarithmic (protests are normal)
  - Authoritarian: linear (protests signal instability)
- Conflict (25%): battles, violence, with UCDP floor scores Security (25%): terrorism keywords, military activity
- Information (25%): internet disruptions, press freedom proxy
Input: GDELT events, ACLED data, static baselines
Output: Map<countryCode, CIIScore>

### 2. Geographic Convergence — convergence.ts
- Bin events into 1°×1° geographic cells
- 24-hour sliding window
- Alert when 3+ distinct event types converge
- Score: type diversity (25pts/type) + event count bonus (2pts/event)
- Severity: notable (3 types), significant (4), critical (5+)

### 3. Temporal Anomaly Detection — anomaly.ts
- Welford's online algorithm for streaming mean/variance
- Per (event_type, region, weekday, month) over 90-day window
- Z-score thresholds: 1.5, 2.0, 3.0
- State persisted in Upstash Redis between sessions

### 4. Military Surge Detection — surge.ts
- Monitor 5+ theaters (Middle East, E. Europe, W. Pacific, Horn of Africa, SCS)
- Track vessel clustering via AIS data
- AIS gap detection ("dark ships")
- 8 strategic chokepoint monitoring

### 5. Infrastructure Cascadde.ts
- When events are geo-located, identify critical infrastructure within 600km
- Rank by distance: pipelines, cables, datacenters, bases, nuclear facilities
- Model how disruptions propagate through interconnected infrastructure
